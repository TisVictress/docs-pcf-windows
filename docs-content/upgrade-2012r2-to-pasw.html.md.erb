<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the changes in functionality associated with moving from Pivotal Application Service for Windows 2012 R2 (PASW 2012 R2) to Pivotal Application Service for Windows (PASW).

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Pivotal Application Service for Windows (PASW) v2.1 and later offers a containerized runtime based on true Windows Server Containers. In this containerized runtime, Windows Diego cells on PAS are using Microsoftâ€™s Windows containers and related features.

As a result, functionality leveraged in the Pivotal Application Service for Windows 2012 R2 (PASW 2012 R2) shared-host container model must be adjusted. In PASW v2.1 and later, Windows containers feature an isolated file system and a more defined role on their host, increasing security and enabling container networking.

### <a id='principles'></a> Guiding Principles  
In this containerized runtime it is important to remember that:

+ Applications within a Windows container have their own file systems and registries.
+ In general, the dependencies in PASW 2012 R2 that were originally made available on the host, should now be provided within the container. 
+ Developers can create similar PASW 2012 R2 app environments by creating bin deployable dependencies and extension buildpacks. For more informtion on extension buildpacks, see [Creating an Extension Buildpack for .NET Apps](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/buildpacks/hwc/extension-buildpack.html).


### <a id='upgrading'></a> Upgrading to PASW

To upgrade, operators must install the new PASW tile alongside the existing PASW 2012 R2 tile. After installation, developers can choose which stack to target in their manifests.

For more information on installing the PASW tile, see [Installing and Configuring PASW](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/windows/installing.html).


<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>
PASW v2.3 is the last version compatible with the PASW 2012 R2 release. The deprecation date for PASW 2012 R2 is December 31, 2019. Contact your Pivotal account team for more information on migration and upgrade options.
