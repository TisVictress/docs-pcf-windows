<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Elastic Runtime has been renamed Pivotal Application Service.</p>


## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Pivotal Application Service for Windows (PASW) enables PCF to host full .NET Framework and Windows-based applications, using Windows Server 2016 and its native containerization features.

By deploying the PAS for Windows tile in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, operators can provision, operate, and manage Diego cells based on Windows Server 2016. Once deployed, developers can then push .NET Framework applications to Windows [Diego cells](../concepts/architecture/index.html#diego-cell) using the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/) (cf CLI) and specifying the `windows2016` stack.

Operators can install PAS for Windows on Microsoft Azure, VMware vSphere, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). See the [note below](#limitations) regarding support for Amazon Web Services.

For more information about how PAS for Windows works, see the [Product Architecture](architecture.html) topic.

For the PAS for Windows release notes, see the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) topic.

## <a id='reqs'></a> Requirements

To install the PAS for Windows tile, you must have:

* Any patch version of Ops Manager v2.1, deployed to vSphere, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure.

* Any patch version of Pivotal Application Service (PAS) v2.1.

* A Windows Server 2016 (v1709) stemcell, which you can obtain by following the directions in [Downloading or Creating Windows Stemcells](./stemcells.html). Note that PAS for Windows uses _Windows Server 2016, Server Core, version 1709._

The minimum recommended resource requirements for each Windows cell are the following:

- Disk size: 64GB
- Memory: 16GB
- Number of CPUs: 4

Due to Microsoftâ€™s licensing requirements, operators must bring their own licensed copies of Windows Server for on-premise deployments (vSphere) or, for public IaaS deployments, pay the surcharges associated with Windows Server licensing determined by the public IaaS provider on Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform.


## <a id='from-2012r2'></a>Upgrading from PAS for Windows 2012R2

As of PCF 2.1, PAS for Windows is a new product offering that uses a new base OS version for its required stemcell. Thus, there is no direct upgrade path from PAS for Windows 2012R2. To upgrade with no downtime for applications, operators must install both PAS for Windows 2.1 and PAS for Windows 2012R2 2.1 and use a blue/green deployment to achieve a zero-downtime upgrade for applications. See [Migrating Apps to PAS for Windows](./migrating.html) for details.

## <a id='limitations'></a>Current Limitations

PAS for Windows has the following limitations:

* Developers cannot yet push Docker or other OCI-compatible images to Windows 2016 cells.
* Container-to-container networking is not yet available for Windows-hosted applications.
* Volume Services are not yet available for Windows-hosted applications.
* OpenStack is currently not supported for PASW. Contact your Pivotal representative for information on OpenStack deployments.
* Currently, _AWS does not provide the version of Windows Server required by PAS for Windows_, Windows Server version 1709. Contact your AWS representative for information regarding the availability of this OS version.

* The following Windows technologies are not supported by PAS for Windows 2012R2:

  - Active Directory Domain Services, i.e. joining Windows cells to an Active Directory domain.
  - Integrated Windows Authentication. Instead, operators should deploy Active Directory Federation Services and the Pivotal SSO tile to enable OAuth-based authentication.

These limitations will be addressed in subsequent versions of the product.

## <a id='issues'></a>Known Issues

PAS for Windows has the following known issues:

* In the PAS for Windows tile **Credentials** tab, the `vcap` credentials that appear when you click **VM Credentials** > **Link to Credential** do not apply to Windows cells, since they do not yet have a vcap user on the Windows host. To establish access for an `Administrator` user, please see the **VM Options** tab to specify a password for that user.

* The controls in the **Advanced Features** pane have no effect.

* In the **Resource Config** pane, setting VM disk size has limitations detailed in the [Configure Tile Resources](./installing.html#resources) table.
