owner: Windows
---

This topic describes how to create a BOSH stemcell for Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Windows on VMware vSphere using `stembuild`.

##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

Before you can deploy PAS for Windows on vSphere, you must create a BOSH stemcell for Windows, a versioned operating system image.
The BOSH stemcell that you create in this topic is based on Windows Server, version 1803.

To create a BOSH stemcell for Windows on vSphere, do the following:

1. [Create a Base VM for the BOSH Stemcell](#create-base-vm)
1. [Configure the Base VM](#install-windows-updates)
1. [Clone the Base VM](#clone-vm)
1. [Construct the BOSH Stemcell](#construct-stemcell)
1. [Package the BOSH Stemcell](#package-stemcell)
1. [Upload the BOSH Stemcell to Ops Manager](#upload-stemcell)

If you already have a BOSH stemcell for Windows on vSphere,
see [Monthly Stemcell Upgrades](#upgrade-stemcell).

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

* A vSphere environment.
* A Windows Server, version 1803, build Number: 17134, from [Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us) or 
[Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC)](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx). 
You can use an evaluation copy for testing, but Pivotal does not recommend an evaluation copy for production, as the licensing expires.  
* The `stembuild` command line interface (CLI) from a release in [Stemcells for PCF (Windows)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-windows-server) on Pivotal Network that corresponds to the operating system of your local host and the stemcell version that you want to build.  
* Microsoft [Local Group Policy Object Utility (LGPO)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319) downloaded to the same folder as your `stembuild` CLI.  
* The minimum vCenter user permissions required to use stembuild for vSphere stemcells, specifically:
    * `VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Modify`
    * `VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Execute`
    * `VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Query`
    * `VirtualMachine.Config.AddRemoveDevice`
    * `VirtualMachine.Interact.SetCDMedia`
    * `VApp.Export`
    * `System.Anonymous`*
    * `System.Read`*
    * `System.View`*

Permissions marked with an `*` are generated upon creating a new user in vCenter and cannot be set within the vCenter UI.

##<a id='create-base-vm'></a>Step 1: Create a Base VM for the BOSH Stemcell

This section describes how to create, configure, and verify a base VM for Windows

1. In the **CD/DVD drive 1** row, clear the **Connected** checkbox to remove the CD drive.
1. Restart the VM.
1. After the VM restarts, verify that you can ping the IP address you assigned to the base VM.

##<a id='clone-vm'></a>Step 3: Clone the Base VM

To clone the base VM, do the following in the vSphere Web Client:

1. Power down the base VM.
1. Right-click the base VM.
1. Select **Clone** > **Clone to Virtual Machine**. This clone is your target VM.
  <%= image_tag('clone-vm.png') %>
1. Save the base VM. You will run Windows updates on this VM for future stemcells.

##<a id='construct-stemcell'></a>Step 4: Construct the BOSH Stemcell

Before constructing the BOSH stemcell, collect the following information from the vCenter Web Client **Inventory** > **VMs and Templates** tab:

* Target VM IP address
* Target VM username
* Target VM password
* vCenter inventory path to the target VM in the `/MY-DATA-CENTER/vm/MY-FOLDER/MY-VM` format where:
  * `MY-DATA-CENTER` is the name of the data center.
  * `vm` is a static string.
  * `MY-FOLDER` is the name of the folder that contains the VM. If the target VM is
  not in a folder, use the `/MY-DATA-CENTER/vm/MY-VM` format instead.
  * `MY-VM` is the name of the target VM.
* vCenter username
* vCenter password
* vCenter URL

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The target VM must be routable from your local host. Before running the <code>construct</code> command, ensure you are logged out of the target VM.</p>

To construct the BOSH stemcell, run the following command from your local host:

```
./STEMBUILD-BINARY construct -vm-ip TARGET-VM-IP -vm-username TARGET-USERNAME -vm-password TARGET-VM-PASSWORD -vcenter-url VCENTER-URL -vcenter-username VCENTER-USERNAME -vcenter-password VCENTER-PASSWORD -vm-inventory-path INVENTORY-PATH
```

Where:

* `STEMBUILD-BINARY` is the `stembuild` file for the version of your local host operating system and the
version of the stemcell that you want to build. For example, `stembuild-windows-1803-7`.
* `TARGET-VM-IP` is the IP address of your target VM.
* `TARGET-USERNAME` is the username of an account with Administrator privileges.
* `TARGET-VM-PASSWORD` is the password for the Administrator account. The password must be enclosed in single quotes.
* `VCENTER-URL` is the URL of your vCenter.
* `VCENTER-USERNAME` is the username of your account in vCenter.
* `VCENTER-PASSWORD` is your password. The password must be enclosed in single quotes.
* `INVENTORY-PATH` is the vCenter inventory path to the target VM.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> This operation may take up to an hour to complete and results in a powered-off target Windows VM in your vSphere environment.
During <code>construct</code> execution, the WinRM connection terminates. This behavior is expected, and the <code>construct</code> command is still being executed.
Do not attempt to re-run the <code>construct</code> command.</p>

If you want to view the status of `construct`, you can log in to the target VM and do the following:

1. Start PowerShell.
1. Run the following command:

    ```
    Get-Content -Path "C:\provision\log.log" -Wait
    ```

##<a id='package-stemcell'></a>Step 5: Package the BOSH Stemcell

To package the BOSH stemcell, do the following:

1. Gather the  vCenter Web Client **VMs and Templates** information that you recorded in the previous step:
  * vCenter inventory path to the target VM in the `/MY-DATA-CENTER/vm/MY-FOLDER/MY-VM` format where:
      * `MY-DATA-CENTER` is the name of the data center.
      * `vm` is a static string.
      * `MY-FOLDER` is the name of the folder that contains the VM. If the target VM is
      not in a folder, use the `/MY-DATA-CENTER/vm/MY-VM` format instead.
      * `MY-VM` is the name of the target VM.
  * vCenter username
  * vCenter password
  * vCenter URL

2. Shut down the VM. If you do not shut down the VM before you continue to the next
step, the package command fails stating that the storage location for the VM could not be read.

3. To package the BOSH stemcell, run the following command from your local host:

* `STEMBUILD-BINARY` is the `stembuild` file for the version of your local host operating system and the
version of the stemcell that you want to build. For example, `stembuild-windows-1803-7`.
* `VCENTER-URL` is the URL of your vCenter.
* `VCENTER-USERNAME` is the username of your account in vCenter.
* `VCENTER-PASSWORD` is your password. The password must be enclosed in single quotes.
* `INVENTORY-PATH` is the vCenter inventory path to the target VM.

    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> This command creates a stemcell on your local host in the folder where you ran the command and might
    take up to 30 minutes to complete.</p>

##<a id='upload-stemcell'></a>Step 6: Upload the BOSH Stemcell to Ops Manager

To upload the BOSH stemcell to Ops Manager, do the following:

1. In Ops Manager, navigate to **Stemcell Library**.
1. Upload your BOSH stemcell.
1. Deploy the PAS for Windows tile.

##<a id='upgrade-stemcell'></a>Monthly Stemcell Upgrades

After Microsoft releases operating system updates, you should upgrade your BOSH stemcell. Microsoft typically
releases Windows updates on the second Tuesday of each month.

To upgrade your BOSH stemcell, do the following:

1. [Install Windows Updates](#install-windows-updates) on the base VM.
1. [Clone the Base VM](#clone-vm).
1. [Construct the BOSH Stemcell](#construct-stemcell).
1. [Package the BOSH Stemcell](#package-stemcell).
1. Replace the existing stemcell in the Ops Manager stemcell library with this new stemcell.
1. Deploy the PAS for Windows tile.

##<a id='known-issues'></a>Known Issues

###<a id='special-characters'></a>Authentication Error with Special Characters in stembuild Commands

**Symptom**

```
./out/stembuild: ServerFaultCode: Cannot complete login due to an incorrect user name or password.
vcenter_client - unable to validate url: vcenter.example.com
```

**Explanation**

`stembuild` uses govc libraries. These libraries cannot parse the special characters
`/`, `#`, and `:`. This results in errors when authenticating with vCenter.

You might also experience this issue on Windows if your password includes a single quote character, `'`. This also affects the Inventory path if it contains a single quote or a space.

**Workaround**

If your vCenter username or password contains `/`, `#`, or `:`, or `'` on Windows, set the following environment variables:

  + **Linux**:

    ```
    export GOVC_USERNAME=VCENTER-USERNAME
    export GOVC_PASSWORD=VCENTER-PASSWORD
    ```

  + **Windows**:

    ```
    set GOVC_USERNAME=VCENTER-USERNAME
    set GOVC_PASSWORD=VCENTER-PASSWORD
    set GOVC_PATH=VCENTER-INVENTORY-PATH
    ```

Where:

- `VCENTER-USERNAME` is your vCenter account username. For example, `johndoe`.
- `VCENTER-PASSWORD` is your vCenter account password. For example, `pass#word`.
- `VCENTER-INVENTORY-PATH` is the location of your VM in the cluster inventory.

If you use other special characters, add single quotes around the input parameters, or set them in an environment variable as described above.

For example:

  + **Linux**:

    ```
    ./STEMBUILD-BINARY package -vcenter-url VCENTER-URL -vcenter-username 'admin@' -vcenter-password VCENTER-PASSWORD -vm-inventory-path INVENTORY-PATH
    ```

  + **Windows**:

    ```
    set GOVC_PASSWORD=A_Strange!PAssword@Here#1
    ./STEMBUILD-BINARY package -vcenter-url VCENTER-URL -vcenter-username %GOVC_USERNAME% -vcenter-password %GOVC_PASSWORD% -vm-inventory-path %GOVC_PATH%
    ```
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Windows environment variables do not automatically override vCenter command line parameters, so you must specify the environment variables in the vCenter command as shown above.</p>
