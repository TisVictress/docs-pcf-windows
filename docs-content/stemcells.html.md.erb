This topic describes how to download or create the stemcell that Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Windows needs to create VMs on an infrastructure.

## <a id="stemcell"></a> Windows Stemcells

BOSH needs a stemcell to supply the basic operating system for any new Windows 2016 server VMs it creates. Depending on your IaaS, you can create or download a stemcell as follows:

* **AWS**: Download the **AWS light Stemcell for Windows 2016 Server** from the **Stemcells for PCF (Windows Server)** section of [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-windows-server).

* **Azure**: Create a stemcell by following the directions in [Create an Azure Stemcell](#azure) below.

* **GCP**: Download the **GCP light Stemcell for Windows 2016 Server** from the **Stemcells for PCF (Windows Server)** section of [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-windows-server).

* **AWS**: Download the **AWS light Stemcell for Windows 2016 Server** from the **Stemcells for PCF (Windows Server)** section of [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-windows-server).

* **vSphere**: Create a stemcell by following the directions in [Creating a vSphere Stemcell by Hand](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-windows-stemcell-builder/wiki/Creating-a-vSphere-Stemcell-by-Hand).

## <a id="azure"></a> Create an Azure Stemcell

On Azure you can create a PAS for Windows stemcell from the Azure Light Stemcell metadata file, which the Azure cloud stores in a public directory. Using this file makes it unnecessary to upload a stemcell manually.

### <a id="req"></a> Prerequisites

1. In the **OpsManager Installation Dashboard**, select **PAS for Windows**. 
1. In the **Settings** tab, select **Resource Config**. 
1. Within the **VM Type** field, ensure that your **Windows Diego Cell** has a disk size of 128&nbsp;GB or larger. 
1. Ensure that the **Install HWC Buildpack Errand** has a VM disk size of 128&nbsp;GB or larger.
1. Navigate to the **Ops Manager Director** of your chosen IaaS.
