## <a id="stemcell"></a> Windows Stemcells

A BOSH stemcell is a versioned OS image wrapped with IaaS-specific packaging. 
BOSH uses a stemcell to supply the basic OS for any Windows VM it creates. 
A typical BOSH stemcell for Windows contains the following:  

* A bare minimum Windows OS skeleton.  
* A BOSH Agent.  
* OS Configuration files and common utilities. 

For more information about stemcells, see [What is a Stemcell?](https://bosh.io/docs/stemcell/) 
in the Cloud Foundry BOSH documentation.
