<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the process of migrating apps running on Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Windows 2012R2 cells to run on PAS for Windows cells, which run Windows Server version 1803.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: PAS for Windows 2012R2 has reached its End of Availability (EoA) and is no longer generally available.</p>

Pivotal recommends you use the blue-green deployment method for high availability. For more information about blue-green deployments, see [Using Blue-Green Deployment to Reduce Downtime and Risk](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html).

## <a id="install-tile"></a> Step 1: Install and Deploy PAS for Windows Tile

To install and deploy the PAS for Windows tile, follow steps 1 and 2 of [Installing and Configuring PAS for Windows](installing.html).

## <a id="push-app"></a> Step 2: Push App to PAS for Windows Cells

Perform the following steps to redeploy a running app with zero downtime using the blue-green method:

1. To log in to the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI), run the following command:

    ```
    cf login
    ```

1. Choose your org and space.

1. Navigate to the location of your app.

1. To find the name of the existing PAS for Windows 2012R2 app you are migrating to PAS for Windows, run the following command:

    ```
    cf apps
    ```

1. Create a new name for the app to replace it. Pivotal recommends you append `-green` to your app name, using the following format:

    ```
    APP-NAME-green
    ```

    Where `APP-NAME` is the PAS for Windows app name.

1. To push the app renamed as APP-NAME-green to a Windows Diego cell, run the following command:

    ```
    cf push APP-NAME-green -s windows -b BUILDPACK -n HOSTNAME --no-start --no-route 
    ```

    Where:
    * `BUILDPACK` is your custom buildpack. Specify buildpack either by name or Git URL with an optional branch or tag.
    * `HOSTNAME` is the subdomain name you are pushing to.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf push ExampleApp-green -s windows -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-buildpack.git -n example.com --no-start --no-route
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>--no-start</code> and <code>--no-route</code> parameters included in this <code>cf push</code> command are required for the this procedure:  
        <ul>
    	    <li><code>--no-start</code> creates the instance VMs but does not start the app.</li>
            <li><code>--no-route</code> prevents the push command from automatically mapping a route to the app.</li>
        </ul>
    
    For more additional <code>cf push</code> command options, see <a href="http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/push.html">cf push</a>.</p>

1. Switch the router so all incoming requests go to ORIGINAL\_APP\_NAME and APP\_NAME-green using the [cf map-route](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/map-route.html) command. The command requires you enter your domain name after the app name. For example, `example.com`.
<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf map-route APP\_NAME-green DOMAIN -n HOSTNAME
</pre>

1. Start the green app.
<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf start APP\_NAME-green
</pre>

1. Run `cf apps` to confirm that both your ORIGINAL\_APP\_NAME and APP\_NAME-green are running. If you experience a problem, see [Troubleshooting Application Deployment and Health](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/troubleshoot-app-health.html).

1. Unmap the original app's route by running the [cf unmap-route](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/unmap-route.html) command.
<pre class="terminal">$ cf unmap-route ORIGINAL\_APP\_NAME DOMAIN -n HOSTNAME </pre>

## <a id="delete-app"></a> Step 3: Delete App from Windows 2012R2 Server Cells

To delete the ORIGINAL\_APP\_NAME, run the [cf delete](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/delete.html) command. To also delete any mapped routes, run the command with the `-r` flag.<pre class="terminal">$ cf delete ORIGINAL\_APP\_NAME -r</pre>


## <a id="uninstall-old-tile"></a> Step 4: (Optional) Uninstall Old Tile

Once you have migrated all of your apps and you are no longer using the Windows 2012R2 tile, a PCF operator can perform the following steps:

1. From the Installation Dashboard, click the trash icon on the tile to remove that product. In the **Delete Product** dialog box that appears, click **Confirm**.
1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
1. Select the PAS for Windows tile and review the changes. For more information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).
1. Click **Apply Changes**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After you delete a product, the product tile is removed from the installation and the Installation Dashboard. However, the product appears in the Available Products view.</p>
