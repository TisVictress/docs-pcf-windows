title: Migrating Apps to PAS for Windows
owner: Windows
---

This topic describes the process of migrating apps running on Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Windows 2012 R2 stemcells to run on PAS for Windows stemcells, which run Windows Server 2019.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: PAS for Windows 2012 R2 has reached its End of Availability (EoA) and is no longer generally available.</p>

Pivotal recommends you use the blue-green deployment method for high availability. For more information about blue-green deployments, see [Using Blue-Green Deployment to Reduce Downtime and Risk](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html).


## <a id="install-tile"></a> Step 1: Install and Deploy PAS for Windows Tile

To install and deploy the PAS for Windows tile, follow steps 1 and 2 of [Installing and Configuring PASW](installing.html).


## <a id="push-app"></a> Step 2: Push App to PAS for Windows Cells

Perform the following steps to redeploy a running app with zero downtime using the blue-green method:

1. To log in to the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI), run the following command:

    ```shell
    cf login
    ```

1. Choose your org and space.

1. Navigate to the location of your app.

1. To find the name of the existing PAS for Windows 2012 R2 app you are migrating to PAS for Windows, run the following command:

    ```shell
    cf apps
    ```

1. Create a name for the replacement PAS for Windows app. Pivotal recommends you append `-green` to your existing app name, using the following format:

    ```text
    APP-NAME-green
    ```

    Where `APP-NAME` is the existing PAS for Windows 2012 R2 app's name.

1. To push your app to a PAS for Windows Diego cell, using your newly created name, run the following command:

    ```shell
    cf push APP-NAME-GREEN -s windows -b BUILDPACK -n HOSTNAME --no-start --no-route
    ```

    Where:
    * `APP-NAME-GREEN` is the newly created "green" name for your app.
    * `BUILDPACK` is your custom buildpack. Specify the buildpack either by name or GitHub URL with an optional branch or tag.
    * `HOSTNAME` is the name of your app's subdomain. For example, if `example.com` is your domain and
    you want the URL to your app to be `http://my-app.example.com`, then specify `my-app` as the `HOSTNAME`.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    C:\Users\admin\> cf push ExampleApp-green -s windows ^
    -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-buildpack.git ^
    -n my-app --no-start --no-route
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>--no-start</code> and <code>--no-route</code> parameters included in this <code>cf push</code> command are required for the this procedure:
    <code>--no-start</code> is used to create the instance VMs and not start the app, and <code>--no-route</code> is used to prevent the push command from automatically mapping a route to the app.
    For additional information about <code>cf push</code>, see <a href="http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/push.html">cf push</a>.</p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>windows</code> stack is a renaming of the old <code>windows2016</code> stack. These stacks are identical and differ in name only.
    If the <code>windows</code> stack is available, specify <code>-s windows</code>. Otherwise, specify <code>-s windows2016</code>. In PAS for Windows v2.5 and later, the <code>windows2016</code> stack is deprecated. 

    For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-5/pcf-release-notes/windows-rn.html#-deprecation-of-the-windows2016-stack">PAS for Windows v2.5 Release Notes</a>.</p>

1. To configure the router so all incoming requests go to both `APP-NAME` and `APP-NAME-green` run the following command:

    ```shell
	cf map-route APP-NAME-green DOMAIN -n HOSTNAME
    ```

    Where:
    * `APP-NAME-green` is the name of the new "green" version of your app.
    * `DOMAIN` is your domain name, for example, `example.com`.
    * `HOSTNAME` is the name of your app's subdomain. For example, if `example.com` is your domain and
    you want the URL to your app to be `http://my-app.example.com`, then specify `my-app` as the `HOSTNAME`.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When using the <code>cf map-route</code> command, you must specify domain name after specifying app name.</p>

    For additional information about `cf map-route`, see [cf map-route](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/map-route.html).

1. To start the green app, run the following command:

    ```shell
	cf start APP-NAME-green
    ```

    Where `APP-NAME-green` is the name of the new "green" version of your app.

1. To confirm that both your `APP-NAME` and `APP-NAME-green` apps are running, run the following command:

    ```shell
    cf apps
    ```

    If you experience a problem, see [Troubleshooting Application Deployment and Health](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/devguide/deploy-apps/troubleshoot-app-health.html).

1. To unmap the original app's route, run the following command:

    ```shell
    cf unmap-route APP-NAME DOMAIN -n HOSTNAME
    ```

    Where:
    * `APP-NAME` is the name of the existing version of your app you want to replace with `APP-NAME-green`.
    * `DOMAIN` is your domain name, for example, `example.com`.
    * `HOSTNAME` is the name of your app's subdomain. For example, if `example.com` is your domain and the existing app is
    currently accessed using the URL `http://my-app.example.com`, then specify `my-app` as the `HOSTNAME`.

    For additional information about `cf-unmap-route`, see [cf unmap-route](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/unmap-route.html).


## <a id="delete-app"></a> Step 3: Delete App from Windows 2012 R2 Server Cells

1. To delete the original app, run the following command:

    ```shell
    cf delete APP-NAME
    ```

    Where `APP-NAME` is the name of the app that you have replaced with `APP-NAME-green`.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To also delete any mapped routes, run the command with the <code>-r</code> flag.</p>

    For additional information about `cf delete`, see [cf delete](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/delete.html).


## <a id="uninstall-old-tile"></a> Step 4: (Optional) Uninstall Old Tile

Once you have migrated all of your apps and you are no longer using the Windows 2012 R2 tile, a <%= vars.product_name %> operator can perform the following steps:

1. From the Installation Dashboard, click the trash icon on the tile to remove that product. In the **Delete Product** dialog box that appears, click **Confirm**.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Select the PAS for Windows tile and review the changes. For more information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After you delete a product, the product tile is removed from the installation and the Installation Dashboard. However, the product appears in the Available Products view.</p>
