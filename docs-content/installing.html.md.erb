This topic describes how to install and configure the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Windows tile. The PAS for Windows tile installs Windows cells on your PCF deployment.

## <a id='reqs'></a> Requirements

To install the PAS for Windows tile, you must have:

* Ops Manager v2.0 or later and PAS v2.0 or later deployed to vSphere, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Azure

* A windows stemcell, which you can obtain by following the directions in [Downloading or Creating Windows Stemcells](./stemcell.html).

The minimum resource requirement for each Windows cell is:

- Disk size: 64&nbsp;GB
- Memory: 16&nbsp;GB
- CPUs: 4

## <a id='ert'></a> Step 1: Confirm PAS Settings

There are two settings in the PAS tile that affect the Windows cells installed by the PAS for Windows tile. Configure these settings as desired:

* In the **Networking** section, if you select the **Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment** checkbox, SSL certificate verification is disabled for Windows cells.
* In the **System Logging** section, if you configure an external syslog aggregator, logs are drained from Windows cells as well as non-Windows cells.

##<a id='install'></a> Step 2: Install the Tile

1. Download the product file from the **PAS for Windows** section of [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/runtime-for-windows).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file. 

1. Click **+** under the uploaded **PAS for Windows** tile to add it to your staging area.

##<a id='config'></a> Step 3: Configure and Deploy the Tile

1. Click the newly added **PAS for Windows** tile.

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks** or **Assign Networks**. The name of the section varies depending on your IaaS.

1. Assign your AZs and networks and click **Save**.

1. Click **VM Options**.

1. Specify how you would like to manage the administrator password for your Windows VMs. The default option is to **Use the Windows default password**.
1. (Optional) Select the **BETA: Enable BOSH-native SSH support on all VMs** checkbox to start the Microsoft beta port of the OpenSSH daemon on port 22 on all VMs. Users will be able to SSH onto Windows VMs with the `bosh ssh` command, and enter a CMD terminal as an administrator user. They can then run `powershell.exe` to start a PowerShell session.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This feature is beta and not considered production-ready.</p>

1. (Optional) If you want your PAS for Windows application workloads to be deployed to an isolation segment, perform the following steps:

    1. Click **Application Containers**.

        <%= image_tag('app_containers_segment_name.png') %>
    1. Under **Segment Name**, enter a name for your isolation segment. Ensure that this name is unique across your PCF deployment.

    1. Click **Save**.
    
    1. Perform the steps in the [Create an Isolation Segment](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html#create-an-is) section of the <em>Managing Isolation Segments</em> topic to create the isolation segment in the Cloud Controller Database (CCDB).

1. Click **Errands**. Pivotal recommends that you set the **Install HWC Buildpack Errand** to **On**. This ensures that you receive the most up-to-date HWC Buildpack.

1. Click **Resource Config** and adjust the number and VM types of your Windows cells as needed.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Stemcell**. Record the stemcell version number required by the tile. 

    <%= image_tag('pcf-windows-tile-stemcell.png') %>

1. Retrieve the stemcell that you downloaded or created in [Download or Create a Windows Stemcell](./stemcell.html).

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to install the PAS for Windows tile.

After you have deployed the PAS for Windows tile, developers can then push .NET applications to Windows cells. For more information, see the [Deploying .NET Apps to Windows Cells](push-windows-apps.html) topic.

##<a id='copy'></a> Step 4: (Optional) Copy the Tile

If you want to create multiple isolation segments for the Windows tile, perform the following steps to copy the **PAS for Windows** tile with the Replicator tool:

1. Download the Replicator tool from the **Pivotal Cloud Foundry Runtime for Windows** section of [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-windows-runtime).

1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Replicator tool.

1. Replicate the tile:
    <pre class="terminal">
    ./replicator \
        -name "YOUR-NAME" \
        -path /PATH/TO/ORIGINAL.pivotal \
        -output /PATH/TO/COPY.pivotal
    </pre>

    Replace the values above with the following:
    * `YOUR-NAME`: Provide a unique name for the new PAS for Windows tile. The name must be ten characters or less and only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and spaces.
    * `/PATH/TO/ORIGINAL`: Provide the absolute path to the original PAS for Windows tile you downloaded from Pivotal Network.
    * `/PATH/TO/COPY`: Provide the absolute path for the copy of the PAS for Windows tile that the Replicator tool produces.

1. Follow the procedures in this topic using the new `.pivotal` file, starting with [Step 1](#ert).
