This topic describes how to install and configure the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Windows tile. The PAS for Windows tile installs Windows cells on your PCF deployment.

## <a id='ert'></a> Step 1: Confirm PAS Settings

There are two settings in the PAS tile that affect the Windows cells installed by the PAS for Windows tile. Configure these settings as desired:

* In the **Networking** section, if you select the **Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment** checkbox, SSL certificate verification is disabled for Windows cells.
* In the **System Logging** section, if you configure an external syslog aggregator, logs are drained from Windows cells as well as non-Windows cells.

##<a id='install'></a> Step 2: Install the Tile

1. Download the product file from the **PAS for Windows** section of [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/runtime-for-windows).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file. 

1. Click **+** under the uploaded **PAS for Windows** tile to add it to your staging area.

##<a id='config'></a> Step 3: Configure and Deploy the Tile

1. Click the newly added **PAS for Windows** tile.

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks** or **Assign Networks**. The name of the section varies depending on your IaaS.

1. Assign your AZs and networks and click **Save**.

1. Click **VM Options**.

1. Specify how you would like to manage the administrator password for your Windows VMs. The default option is to **Use the Windows default password**.
1. (Optional) Select the **BETA: Enable BOSH-native SSH support on all VMs** checkbox to start the Microsoft beta port of the OpenSSH daemon on port 22 on all VMs. Users will be able to SSH onto Windows VMs with the `bosh ssh` command, and enter a CMD terminal as an administrator user. They can then run `powershell.exe` to start a PowerShell session.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This feature is beta and not considered production-ready.</p>

1. (Optional) If you want all VMs to support connection via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), click **Enable Remote Desktop Protocol**. 

1. (Optional) If you want to configure a Key Management Service (KMS) that your volume-licensed Windows cell can register with, perform the following steps:
    1. Click **Enable**
    2. For the **Host** field, enter the KMS hostname.
    3. For the **Port** field, enter the port number. The default port number is `1688`.

1. (Optional) If you want your PAS for Windows application workloads to be deployed to an isolation segment, perform the following steps:

    1. Click **Application Containers**.

        <%= image_tag('app_containers_segment_name.png') %>
    1. Under **Segment Name**, enter a name for your isolation segment. Ensure that this name is unique across your PCF deployment.

    1. Click **Save**.
    
    1. Perform the steps in the [Create an Isolation Segment](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html#create-an-is) section of the <em>Managing Isolation Segments</em> topic to create the isolation segment in the Cloud Controller Database (CCDB).

1. Click **Errands**. Pivotal recommends that you set the **Install HWC Buildpack Errand** to **On**. This ensures that you receive the most up-to-date HWC Buildpack.

1. Click **Resource Config** and adjust the number and VM types of your Windows cells as needed.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Stemcell**. Record the stemcell version number required by the tile. 

    <%= image_tag('pcf-windows-tile-stemcell.png') %>

1. Retrieve the stemcell that you downloaded or created in [Download or Create a Windows Stemcell](./stemcells.html).

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to install the PAS for Windows tile.

After you have deployed the PAS for Windows tile, developers can then push .NET applications to Windows cells. For more information, see the [Developing and Deploying .NET Apps](./using.html) topic.

###<a id='isolation'></a> Windows Isolation Segments

You can deploy multiple copies of the PAS for Windows tile to create isolation segments for Windows cells. Isolation segments define compartmentalized resource pools for Diego cells that do not share routing, computing, or logging resources, but are managed by the same Cloud Controller.

See the [Replicate the Tile to Create Isolation Segments](#isolation) step below for how to create multiple Windows isolation segments. The [Installing PCF Isolation Segment](../customizing/installing-pcf-is.html) topic explains how to create Linux isolation segments.

##<a id='copy'></a> Step 4: (Optional) Replicate the Tile to Create Isolation Segments

You can use the Replicator tool to copy the **PAS for Windows** tile and create multiple isolation segments as follows:

1. Download the Replicator tool from the **Pivotal Cloud Foundry Runtime for Windows** section of [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-windows-runtime).

1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Replicator tool.

1. Replicate the tile:
    <pre class="terminal">
    ./replicator \
        -name "YOUR-NAME" \
        -path /PATH/TO/ORIGINAL.pivotal \
        -output /PATH/TO/COPY.pivotal
    </pre>

    Replace the values above with the following:
    * `YOUR-NAME`: Provide a unique name for the new PAS for Windows tile. The name must be ten characters or less and only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and spaces.
    * `/PATH/TO/ORIGINAL`: Provide the absolute path to the original PAS for Windows tile you downloaded from Pivotal Network.
    * `/PATH/TO/COPY`: Provide the absolute path for the copy of the PAS for Windows tile that the Replicator tool produces.

1. Install and configure the Windows isolation segment, using the new `.pivotal` file and following the procedures in this topic, starting with the **Import a Product** step of [Step 2: Install the Tile](#install).
