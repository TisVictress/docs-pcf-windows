This topic describes how to install and configure the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Windows tile. The PAS for Windows tile installs Windows cells on your PCF deployment.

## <a id='ert'></a> Step 1: Confirm Shared PAS Tile Settings

There are two settings in the **Pivotal Application Service** tile that affect the Windows cells installed by the **PAS for Windows** tile. Configure these settings as desired:

* In the **Networking** section, if you select the **Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment** checkbox, SSL certificate verification is disabled for Windows cells.
* In the **System Logging** section, if you configure an external syslog aggregator, logs are drained from Windows cells as well as non-Windows cells.

##<a id='install'></a> Step 2: Install the Tile

1. Download the **Pivotal Application Service for Windows** product file from the product page of [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pas-windows).

1. From the same [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pas-windows) page, download the **PAS for Windows File System Injector** tool for your workstation OS.
</br>
</br>
The Injector tool, `winfs-injector`, is an executable binary that adds the Windows Server container base image into the product file. This step requires internet access and can take up to 20 minutes.
</br>
 <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You need the `git` and `tar` (BSD) executables on your `%PATH%` in order to run the `winfs-injector` bin. For example, to use  `winfs-injector.exe`, `tar.exe` must be copied to a folder in your `%PATH%`.
 </p>

1. Run `winfs-injector` with the following options, replacing `PAS-WINDOWS-DOWNLOADED.pivotal` with the path to the downloaded **PAS for Windows** product file and `PAS-WINDOWS-INJECTED.pivotal` with a desired output path for the importable product file:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ winfs-injector --input-tile PAS-WINDOWS-DOWNLOADED.pivotal \
    --output-tile PAS-WINDOWS-INJECTED.pivotal
    </pre>
  For troubleshooting the `winfs-injector`, see [Missing Local Certificates for Windows File System Injector](./troubleshooting.html#missing-certs-winfs-issues).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**.

1. Select the importable `PAS-WINDOWS-INJECTED.pivotal` file on your workstation. **PAS for Windows** appears in the product list under **Import a Product**.

1. Click **+** under the **PAS for Windows** product listing to add it to your staging area.

##<a id='config'></a> Step 3: Configure the Tile

1. Click the newly added **PAS for Windows** tile.

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks** or **Assign Networks**. The name of the section varies depending on your IaaS.

1. Assign your AZs and networks and click **Save**.

1. Click **VM Options**.

    <%= image_tag('vm-options.png') %>

1. Specify your selection for **Manage Administrator Password**.
  * **Use the Windows default password** randomizes the administrator password. With this selection, the administrator password is not retrievable by an operator. This is the default selection.
  * **Set the password** sets the same administrator password for every Windows cell. As a result, this password can be used to access any Windows cell, including, for example, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions.

1. (Optional) Select the **BETA: Enable BOSH-native SSH support on all VMs** checkbox to start the Microsoft beta port of the OpenSSH daemon on port 22 on all VMs. Users will be able to SSH onto Windows VMs with the `bosh ssh` command, and enter a CMD terminal as an administrator user. They can then run `powershell.exe` to start a PowerShell session.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This feature is beta and not considered production-ready.</p>

1. (Optional) If you want all VMs to support connection through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), click **Enable Remote Desktop Protocol**.

1. (Optional) If you want to configure a Key Management Service (KMS) that your volume-licensed Windows cell can register with, perform the following steps:
    1. Click **Enable**
    2. For the **Host** field, enter the KMS hostname.
    3. For the **Port** field, enter the port number. The default port number is `1688`.

    ![The enable KMS text fields: host and port](enable-kms.png)

1. Click **Save**.

1. (Optional) To deploy your PAS for Windows application workloads to an isolation segment, click **Application Containers** and perform the steps in the [Assign a Tile to an Isolation Segment](./isolation.html#assign-isolation) section below.

1. (Optional) To configure Windows cells to send Windows Event logs to an external syslog server, click **System Logging** and perform the steps in the [Send Cell Logs to a Syslog Server](./troubleshooting.html#syslog) section.

1. (Optional) To enable advanced features in PAS for Windows,
click **Advanced Features** and perform the following steps:

  1. To configure memory and disk overcommit for your Windows Diego cells,
  follow the steps below:

      1. Enter the total desired amount of Diego cell memory in the **Cell Memory Capacity (MB)** field.
      For the current cell memory capacity settings, refer to the Windows Diego Cell row
      on the **Resource Config** pane.

      1. Enter the total desired amount of Diego cell disk capacity in the **Cell Disk Capacity (MB)** field.
      For the current cell disk capacity settings, refer to the Windows Diego Cell row
      on the **Resource Config** pane.
      <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Due to the risk of app failure and the deployment-specific nature of disk and memory use,
      Pivotal has no recommendation about how much, if any, memory or disk space to overcommit.</p>
      <%= image_tag("images/advanced-features.png") %>

  1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Errands**. Pivotal recommends that you set the **Install HWC Buildpack Errand** to **On**. This ensures that you receive the most up-to-date HWC Buildpack.

### Configure BOSH Director Resources

1. On the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the BOSH Director tile.
1. Select the **Resource Config** pane.
1. Use the dropdown menu to provision the **Master Compilation Job** with the minumum disk space
for your IaaS as follows:
  * **AWS**: 128&nbsp;GB
  * **Azure**: 100&nbsp;GB
  * **GCP**: 100&nbsp;GB
  * **vSphere**: 128&nbsp;GB

1. Click **Save**.

### Configure PAS for Windows Tile Resources

1. On the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the PAS for Windows tile.
1. Select the **Resource Config** pane.
1. Use the dropdown menus to configure **Windows Diego Cell**.
For more information, see [Disk Size of Windows Diego Cells](#disk).
1. Click **Save**.

#### <a name='disk'></a> Disk Size of Windows Diego Cells

Before configuring the disk size of your Windows Diego cells,
review the information below:

* **Windows stemcells v1709.13 and later in the 1709 line** support ephemeral disks.
If your PAS for Windows deployment is based on one of these stemcells,
the recommended disk size for your Windows Diego cells is as follows:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>IaaS</th>
      <th>Disk size of Windows Diego cell</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>AWS</th>
      <td>100 GB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Azure</th>
      <td>150 GB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>GCP</th>
      <td>150 GB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>vSphere</th>
      <td>100 GB</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you use vSphere, you must create your own stemcell.
  The default root disk size of Windows stemcell v1709.13 and later in the 1709 line is 30 GB.
  Pivotal recommends setting the root disk size of your Windows stemcell for vSphere to 30 GB.
  For more information, see <a href="create-vsphere-stemcell.html">Creating a vSphere Windows Stemcell</a>.</p>

* **Windows stemcells v1709.5 through v1709.12** do not support ephemeral disks.
The size of the root disk of your stemcell determines
the minimum root disk size of any Windows VM that the BOSH Director can create from that stemcell.
If your PAS for Windows deployment is based on one of these stemcells,
ensure that **Windows Diego Cell** has a minimum disk size according to the table below.
  <table id='disk-sizes' border="1" class="nice" >
    <tr>
      <th>IaaS</th>
      <th>Disk size of Windows stemcell v1709.5-v1709.12</th>
    <tr>
      <th>AWS</th>
      <td>128 GB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Azure</th>
      <td>30 GB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>GCP</th>
      <td>100 GB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>vSphere</th>
      <td>Recommended 128 GB+</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Because you create your own stemcell on vSphere,
    you can control its root disk size.</p>

##<a id='stemcells'></a> Step 5: Upload the Stemcell

1. Go to **Stemcell Library**.

1. Retrieve the stemcell that you downloaded or created in [Downloading or Creating a Windows Stemcell](./stemcells.html).

1. Follow the steps in [Importing and Managing Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/managing-stemcells.html) to upload the Windows stemcell to **Pivotal Application Service for Windows**.


##<a id='deploy'></a> Step 6: Deploy the Tile

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to install the PAS for Windows tile.


##<a id='copy'></a> Step 7: (Optional) Create More Tiles

To run Windows cells in multiple isolation segments, you must create and configure additional PAS for Windows tiles. For more information, see [Windows Cells in Isolation Segments](./isolation.html).
