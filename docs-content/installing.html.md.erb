This topic describes how to install and configure the Pivotal Application Service for Windows (PASW) tile. 

If you have the PASW 2012 R2 tile installed, see [Migrating from PASW 2012 R2 to PASW](./upgrade-2012r2-to-pasw.html) for more information about the changes in features and functionality between the two tile versions.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The PASW tile installs Windows Diego Cells in your <%= vars.first_product_name  %> deployment.

The PASW tile inherits settings from the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile and also includes additional configuration settings.

To install, configure, and deploy PASW, do the following:  

1. Complete the prerequisites. See [Prerequisite](#prerequisite).
1. Download and install the PASW tile. See [Install the Tile](#install).
1. Configure required settings for the tile. See [Configure the Tile](#config).
1. Configure resources for the tile. See [Configure Tile Resources](#resources).
1. Upload the Windows stemcell to the tile. See [Upload the Stemcell](#stemcells).
1. Deploy the tile. See [Deploy the Tile](#deploy).


## <a id='prerequisite'></a> Prerequisite

Before you install and configure the PASW tile, you must disable SSL certificate verification for all Windows Diego cells on development and testing environments.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Only disable SSL certificate verification for development and testing environments. Do not disable SSL certificate verification for production environments.</p>

To disable SSL validation on development and testing environments, do the following:

1. In the PAS tile, go to the **Networking** pane. 

1. Select the **Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment** checkbox. 

For more information, see the [Procedure: Terminate SSL/TLS at HAProxy](../opsguide/ssl-term-haproxy.html#haproxy) section of _Configuring SSL/TLS Termination at HAProxy_.


##<a id='install'></a> Install the Tile

To install the PASW tile, do the following:

1. Download the **Pivotal Application Service for Windows** product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pas-windows).

1. Within [Pivotal Application Service for Windows](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pas-windows), download the **Windows FS Injector** tool for your workstation OS.<br><br>
The Injector tool, `winfs-injector`, is an executable binary that adds the Windows Server container base image into the product file. This step requires internet access and can take up to 20 minutes.<br>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You need the <code>git</code> and <code>tar</code> executables in your <code>%PATH%</code> to run <code>winfs-injector.exe</code>. For example, copy <code>git.exe</code> and <code>tar.exe</code> to a directory in your <code>%PATH%</code>.</p>

1. To add the Windows Server container base image to the product file, run the following command:

    ```shell
    winfs-injector --input-tile PASW-DOWNLOAD-PATH --output-tile PASW-IMPORTABLE-PATH
    ```

    Where:
    * `PASW-DOWNLOAD-PATH` is the path and filename to the PASW product file you downloaded.
    * `PASW-IMPORTABLE-PATH` is the desired output path for the importable product file.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    C:\Users\admin\> winfs-injector --input-tile ^
    c:\temp\pas-windows-2.6.0-build.1.pivotal ^
    --output-tile c:\temp\pas-windows-2.6.0-build.1-INJECTED.pivotal
    </pre>

    For information about troubleshooting `winfs-injector`, see [Missing Local Certificates for Windows File System Injector](./troubleshooting.html#missing-certs-winfs-issues) in _Troubleshooting Windows Cells_.

1. To enable forwarding BOSH job logs to an external syslog server,
add the following BOSH add-on to a `runtime_config` YAML file:

    ```yaml
    releases:
    - name: windows-syslog
      version: latest

    addons:
    - name: windows-syslog
      include:
        stemcell:
        - os: ((Stemcell OS e.g., windows2019))
      jobs:
      - name: syslog_forwarder_windows
        properties:
          syslog:
            address: ((IP address of the syslog server))
            port: ((Port of the syslog server))
            transport: ((tcp or udp))
            # Optional. If you enabled SSL certificate
            # verification in PAS, you must configure
            # `tls_enabled:` and `ca_cert:`.
            tls_enabled: true
            ca_cert: ((TLS CA certificate of the syslog server))
        release: windows-syslog
    ```

    For more information about BOSH add-ons, see
    [Addons Block](https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config/#addons) in the BOSH documentation.
