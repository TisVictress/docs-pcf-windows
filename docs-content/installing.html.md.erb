This topic describes how to install and configure the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Windows tile. The PAS for Windows tile installs Windows Diego cells on your PCF deployment.

## <a id='ert'></a> Step 1: Confirm Shared PAS Tile Settings

There are two settings in the **Pivotal Application Service** tile that affect the Windows Diego cells installed by the **PAS for Windows** tile. Configure these settings as desired:

* In the **Networking** section, if you select the **Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment** checkbox, SSL certificate verification is disabled for Windows Diego cells.
* In the **System Logging** section, if you configure an external syslog aggregator, logs are drained from Windows Diego cells as well as non-Windows Diego cells.

##<a id='install'></a> Step 2: Install the Tile

1. Download the **Pivotal Application Service for Windows** product file from the product page of [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pas-windows).

1. From the same [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pas-windows) page, download the **PAS for Windows File System Injector** tool for your workstation OS.
</br>
</br>
The Injector tool, `winfs-injector`, is an executable binary that adds the Windows Server container base image into the product file. This step requires internet access and can take up to 20 minutes.
</br>
 <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You need the `git` and `tar` (BSD) executables on your `%PATH%` in order to run the `winfs-injector` bin. For example, to use  `winfs-injector.exe`, `tar.exe` must be copied to a folder in your `%PATH%`.
 </p>

1. Run `winfs-injector` with the following options, replacing `PAS-WINDOWS-DOWNLOADED.pivotal` with the path to the downloaded **PAS for Windows** product file and `PAS-WINDOWS-INJECTED.pivotal` with a desired output path for the importable product file:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ winfs-injector --input-tile PAS-WINDOWS-DOWNLOADED.pivotal \
    --output-tile PAS-WINDOWS-INJECTED.pivotal
    </pre>
  For troubleshooting the `winfs-injector`, see [Missing Local Certificates for Windows File System Injector](./troubleshooting.html#missing-certs-winfs-issues).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**.

1. Select the importable `PAS-WINDOWS-INJECTED.pivotal` file on your workstation. **PAS for Windows** appears in the product list under **Import a Product**.

1. Click **+** under the **PAS for Windows** product listing to add it to your staging area.

##<a id='config'></a> Step 3: Configure the Tile

1. Click the newly added **PAS for Windows** tile.

    <%= image_tag('pcf-windows-tile-orange.png') %>

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks** or **Assign Networks**. The name of the section varies depending on your IaaS.

1. Assign your AZs and networks and click **Save**.

1. Click **VM Options**.

    <%= image_tag('vm-options.png') %>

1. Specify your selection for **Manage Administrator Password**.
  * **Use the Windows default password** randomizes the administrator password. With this selection, the administrator password is not retrievable by an operator. This is the default selection.
  * **Set the password** sets the same administrator password for every Windows Diego cell. As a result, this password can be used to access any Windows Diego cell, including, for example, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions.

1. (Optional) Select the **BETA: Enable BOSH-native SSH support on all VMs** checkbox to start the Microsoft beta port of the OpenSSH daemon on port 22 on all VMs. Users will be able to SSH onto Windows VMs with the `bosh ssh` command, and enter a CMD terminal as an administrator user. They can then run `powershell.exe` to start a PowerShell session.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This feature is beta and not considered production-ready.</p>

1. (Optional) If you want all VMs to support connection through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), click **Enable Remote Desktop Protocol**.

1. (Optional) If you want to configure a Key Management Service (KMS) that your volume-licensed Windows Diego cell can register with, perform the following steps:
    1. Click **Enable**
    2. For the **Host** field, enter the KMS hostname.
    3. For the **Port** field, enter the port number. The default port number is `1688`.

1. (Optional) To deploy your PAS for Windows application workloads to an isolation segment, click **Application Containers** and perform the steps in the [Assign a Tile to an Isolation Segment](./isolation.html#assign-isolation) section below.

1. (Optional) To configure Windows Diego cells to send Windows Event logs to an external syslog server, click **System Logging** and perform the steps in the [Send Cell Logs to a Syslog Server](./troubleshooting.html#syslog) section.

1. Click **Errands**. Pivotal recommends that you set the **Install HWC Buildpack Errand** to **On**. This ensures that you receive the most up-to-date HWC Buildpack.

1. Click **Save**.

##<a id='resources'></a> Step 4: Configure Tile Resources

To configure your tile resources, navigate to the **Resource Config** pane of the PAS for Windows tile and
use the drop-down menus for each job.

The minimum disk size requirements for your Windows Diego cells and the Ops Manager compilation VM
depend on the version of Windows stemcell that you use:

* **Windows stemcell v1709.13 and later**. These stemcells support ephemeral disks.
To configure the disk size of your Windows Diego cells and the Ops Manager compilation VM:
  1. Review the recommended minimum resource requirements in
  [Resource Requirements for Deployments Based on Windows Stemcell v1709.13 and Later](#1709-13).
  1. Follow the instructions in [Select Windows Diego Cell Disk Size](#cell-disk) and [Select Master Compilation Job Disk Size](#compilation-job-disk).
* **Windows stemcell v1709.5 through v1709.12**. These stemcells do not support ephemeral disks.
To configure the disk size of your Windows Diego cells and the Ops Manager compilation VM:
  1. Review the recommended minimum resource requirements
  in [Resource Requirements for Deployments Based on Windows Stemcell v1709.5 through v1709.12](#1709-5).
  1. Follow the instructions in [Select Windows Diego Cell Disk Size](#cell-disk) and [Select Master Compilation Job Disk Size](#compilation-job-disk).

### <a name="1709-13"></a> Resource Requirements for Deployments Based on Windows Stemcell v1709.13 and Later

For each Windows Diego cell configured in the **Resource Config** pane of the PAS for Windows tile,
the recommended minimum resource requirements are as follows:

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Windows Diego Cell</th>
    <th>AWS</th>
    <th>Azure</th>
    <th>GCP</th>
    <th>vSphere</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Ephemeral disk</td>
    <td>100 GB</td>
    <td>150 GB</td>
    <td>150 GB</td>
    <td>100 GB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Memory</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>

<tr>
    <td>CPU</td>
    <td>2 cores</td>
    <td>2 cores</td>
    <td>2 cores</td>
    <td>2 cores</td>
</tr>
</table>

For the Master Compilation Job configured in the **Resource Config** pane of the BOSH Director tile,
the recommended minimum resource requirements are as follows:

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Master Compilation Job</th>
    <th>AWS</th>
    <th>Azure</th>
    <th>GCP</th>
    <th>vSphere</th>

</tr>
<tr>
    <td>CPU</td>
    <td>2 cores</td>
    <td>2 cores</td>
    <td>2 cores</td>
    <td>2 cores</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong>
If you use vSphere, you must create your own stemcell. Pivotal recommends setting the root disk size of your Windows stemcell for vSphere to 30 GB.
For more information, see <a href="create-vsphere-stemcell.html">Creating a vSphere Windows Stemcell</a>.</p>

### <a name="1709-5"></a> Resource Requirements for Deployments Based on Windows Stemcell v1709.5 Through v1709.12

Windows stemcells v1709.5 through v1709.12 do not support ephemeral disks.
The size of the root disk of your stemcell determines
the minimum root disk size of any Windows VM that the BOSH Director can create from that stemcell.

For more information, see the table below:

<table id='disk-sizes' border="1" class="nice" >
  <tr>
    <th>IaaS</th>
    <th>Windows stemcell v1709.5-v1709.12 disk size</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Azure</th>
    <td>30 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>AWS</th>
    <td>128 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>GCP</th>
    <td>100 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>vSphere</th>
    <td>Recommended 128 GB+<sup>*</sup></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<sup>*</sup> Because you create your own stemcell on vSphere, you can control its root disk size.
For more information, see [Creating a vSphere Windows Stemcell](create-vsphere-stemcell.html).
